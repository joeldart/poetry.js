This piece is about the fundamental struggle that comes from firstly the big questions around truth, science, and religion. 
In the name of acceptance, we have our truce that "it doesn't matter what you believe," and yet we know the binary nature
of truth suggests that this is a relatively hollow answer for the question. The malleable nature of undefined serves as a
fitting reminder that your comparisons and equivalence has profound impacts on your world. What is the role of science when
it doesn't matter what you believe about the origins of the universe? How do you coexist peacefully alongside truth claims 
that are incompatible? Is redefining undefined the safest bet for tackling these hard problems?

The second struggle is the notion of livign your life under a non-falsifable claim. The hard questions remain unsolved
because the truth exists but simply cannot be determined prior to runtime. This is mirrored in the way that the binary
of truth gets set based on a "random" generation at the start. I use quotes because we know the cryptography of Math.random
is not particularly perfect. There are definite clues left that could allow for predictions - we can model what this world 
would look like given certain parameters without running the program, but few are truly capable or take the time to do such 
things.

The final struggle is the moral implications of this truth. Being from the American Bible Belt, I used a specifically Christian 
phrase to contain all the other meaning, but the struggle exists within all other contexts as well and should be pondered as such. 
Historically, each worldview religious and irreligious has a rich tradition of good and evil. In the context of Christianity, 
there has been an immense amount of work promoting social justice as well as work to systematically discriminate. How do we take 
the first and second struggles to understanding these histories - our own or of others. How do we own the evil that is caused by 
a worldview that, in actuality, is actually the truth. How do we wrestle with the thought of so much good being brought to the 
world by a system of lies?
