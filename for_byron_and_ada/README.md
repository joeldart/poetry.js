#### Artist Statement
This piece is inspired by famed poet Lord Byron and his daughter
Ada Lovelace, the first computer programmer. It considers the 
connection between creative pursuits and the backing spirit of
creativity that makes all of it possible.

The poem mostly consists of object graphs, resembling trees. But two trees are 
called out explicitly in the poem via their assignment of their 
prototypes. Later on, fitting the text, these trees intertwine
but do so with the very object that is their shared root.
