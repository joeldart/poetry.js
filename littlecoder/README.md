I wanted to try and write a short children's story, similar to what Dr. Sueuss in length, but in JavaScript. A challenge for this, then, is that I couldn't as easily work the story into 2 parts like I often did with other poems (the introduction where I set up all the variables, functions, and objects that are used and the the exposition which uses them). Instead, I want to use the introduction and various other devices as decoration to be used alongside illustrations. I'm not an illustrator, so this will come with time of course, but that's the idea behind this.. 

As a children's story, I wanted to give this a feeling of adventure, so I decided to highlight what is, in my opinion, the most heroic feature of the language: hoisting. What I find so heroic about hoisting is the impact that it has on the way you read your code. When reading c code, you have your variables declared at the top and when you reach an undeclared variable it is regarded as an error. Because of our knowledge of problems with global namespace abuse, you get the same uneasy feeling when you hit an undeclared variable in JavaScript. But there's one exception, though: hoisting. You look at that function and you might get that uneasy feeling but then look below and see it's part of a function declaration and no more worries! We're saved again! Thank you function hoisting!

Then after that I wanted to do some [word painting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_painting) with some of the rest of the lyrics.
