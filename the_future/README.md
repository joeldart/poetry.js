This poem is written using the next version of JavaScript, not truly available to us
today. New syntax especially gives a sense of "it will be great when" - offers a 
target for hope from some of the tedium we have to go through to achieve the same 
results today.

Additionally, this poem has an instance of infinite recursion, which yields a stackoverflow
exception (as infinite recursion is known to do). For the muggles, when a function is called, 
it pushes the current function down on the stack. Recursion is the process of not really answering
questions about what a function returns but just pushing down more functions. It's intended to get 
some relief through a base case that will let us make sense of everything else. But every stack 
has its limit. And if you push it down too much, it will erupt with an exception. 

I wrote this poem the night of the Ferguson grand jury's decision. I remember rocking
my 8-month-old son to sleep and just feeling lost in the saddness. Trying to console 
myself by watching the anger, confusion, and mourning on twitter. It felt like that 
moment was the bottom, but now I know I had no idea how much worse it would get.
