This poem is about the unconscious forces - the invisible hands - that have placed us where we are. The text of this poem is very strong and confident.
The narrator very clearly has accomplished much, or at least believes so, and is proud of said accomplishments. Underlying this text, though, is code
that makes a seasoned veteran quite uncomfortable. Every variable is a global and we actually we control being coerced silently into the string "[object Object]".
It is noteworthy that the execution of the program is not a catastrophic failure, at least in the sense that it does not crash or loop infinitely. It comes 
and goes quickly. This is to say that the coercion nor globals are not intended to be explicit negative forces - not bad things - but powerful ones working in their own ways.
